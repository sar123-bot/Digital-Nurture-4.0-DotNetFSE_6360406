Step 4: Time Complexity Analysis
===============================

Linear Search:
--------------
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Explanation: In the worst case, linear search checks each element once until it finds the target or reaches the end.
- Best Case: O(1) when the target is the first element.
- Average and Worst Case: O(n), where n is the number of products.

Binary Search:
--------------
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Explanation: Binary search repeatedly divides the sorted array in half to find the target, significantly reducing the number of comparisons.
- Requires the array to be sorted beforehand.
- Best Case: O(1) when the target is at the middle.
- Average and Worst Case: O(log n).

Comparison and Suitability:
---------------------------
- For small datasets or unsorted arrays, linear search is simple and sufficient.
- For large datasets, binary search is far more efficient due to its logarithmic time.
- However, binary search requires sorting the data first, which adds O(n log n) complexity if done repeatedly.
- In an e-commerce platform, if products are frequently added or updated, maintaining a sorted data structure or using advanced data structures (like balanced trees or hash indexes) is recommended.
- If search performance is critical and the dataset is large, binary search or even more advanced indexing/search algorithms should be preferred.

Summary:
--------
- Linear search is easy to implement but inefficient for large datasets.
- Binary search offers faster search times but depends on sorted data.
- Choice depends on data size, update frequency, and performance requirements.
