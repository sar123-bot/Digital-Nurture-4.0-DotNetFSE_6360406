Step 1: Understand Recursive Algorithms
======================================

Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into manageable subproblems.

Key points about recursion:
- Each recursive call works on a smaller input.
- A base case stops the recursion to prevent infinite calls.
- Recursion can be elegant but may have performance drawbacks if not managed properly (e.g., repeated calculations or deep call stacks).

Common examples where recursion is used:
- Calculating factorial of a number
- Generating Fibonacci sequence
- Traversing tree or graph data structures

Recursion helps to write cleaner and more readable code for problems that have a natural recursive structure.
